		sideNote2: "",
		blogPart2:
			"At the start of the policy, the insured is required to indicate the value of the vehicle. However, it is advisable to use the current market value of the car to avoid any discrepancies in the event of a claim. The market value of your car is the current worth of your vehicle in the current market, and it takes into account factors such as the car's model, age, mileage, and overall condition.",
		blogPart3:
			"In addition to the insured's valuation, insurance companies also conduct a pre-loss inspection of the vehicle to assess its value. The pre-loss inspection is conducted by the survey unit, which is responsible for assessing the risk associated with the car and determining its value. During the inspection, the survey unit will assess the car's physical condition, age, and mileage, among other factors, to determine its value.",
		blogPart4:
			"It is important to note that the value of the car is not static, and it can change over time due to factors such as depreciation, market fluctuations, and other external factors. As a result, insurance companies may request a new valuation of your car at the time of policy renewal or in the event of a claim.",
		blogPart5:
			"In conclusion, car valuation is an essential aspect of car insurance policies. It determines the premium you pay and the amount you receive in the event of a claim. While the insured is responsible for indicating the value of the vehicle at the start of the policy, insurance companies also conduct pre-loss inspections to determine the car's value. We advise that you use the current market value of your vehicle to ensure that you have adequate coverage in the event of a claim.",

			"Let's say you were in a fender bender that resulted in damage to the right-side passenger door of your car. According to your insurance policy, the insurer is obligated to repair the damaged door and paint the right-side door only. However, if you request that the entire car be painted, you will be required to contribute to the cost of painting.",
		blogPart3:
			"This is because the insurance company is only obligated to repair what was damaged in the accident. Any additional repairs or replacements that go beyond the scope of the accident will come at an additional cost to you. So, if you want your car to look like new again and decide to have other parts of the car repainted or replaced, you will be responsible for paying the extra costs.",
		blogPart4:
			"It's important to understand that betterment clauses are common in insurance policies, especially for car insurance. The reason for this is to prevent insured parties from profiting from a loss. Without a betterment clause, an insured could have a vehicle that was in poor condition before the accident, but could end up with a brand new, fully repaired car after the accident without paying anything extra. Betterment clauses ensure that the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged parts is shared between the insurer and the insured, based on the extent of the damage.",
		blogPart5:
			"In conclusion, if you're ever in an accident and need to file an insurance claim, it's important to understand the betterment clause in your policy. This will help you make informed decisions about repairs and replacements and avoid any unexpected out-of-pocket costs. Remember, your insurer is only obligated to repair what was damaged in the accident, any additional repairs or replacements will come at an additional cost to you.",

		blogPart3:
			"It's not very difficult to understand. The insurance company is full of people who do analytics on the probability of such damages occurring. They know that there is no way everybody who gets insurance will use it to pay for damages at the same time. Let's say that 40 people get insurance from the same company, and pay 5000 naira a month, that is about 200,000 naira monthly. You cannot tell me that all 40 people will have car crashes in the same month. So when one person has a car crash, the insurance company can comfortably pool funds provided by the other users to offset the damage of that one party. This way everybody is taken care of.",
		blogPart4:
			"Some insurance companies also invest with these premiums paid by the people using their services, the way banks do. This way, even if everyone using their services decides to crash their cars on the same weekend, they will still be able to provide for all their bills.",
